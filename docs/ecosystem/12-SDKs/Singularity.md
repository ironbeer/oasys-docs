Singularity Payments makes game payments smooth on Oasys

Singularityis a method that can improve the payment UX of games developed with Oasys and reduce the implementation time.

## What you can achieve with Singularity Payments

When purchasing in-game items (including NFT and Fungible Tokens), press the purchase button “Buy” and the payment function (Drawer) will be displayed.

Even if users do not have game-specific tokens, they can make payments with their own tokens.
Singularity achieves this by leveraging Tealswap, DEX on Oasys.

- For NFT purchases, display credit card payment options
- For the Fungible tokens Display a list of tokens held by the user
  - The displayed FT can be changed in the game settings.
  - If the balance is insufficient for the purchase amount, it will be displayed in gray.

## Improved game UX

Users can save the trouble of preparing special FTs and make payments without leaving the game screen, improving the UX.

## Benefits for game developers

- By introducing the SDK, you can reduce the amount of time required to develop and implement payment functions.
- Improve UX by creating an environment that makes it easy for users to purchase items in-game. Promotes in-game token circulation.
  - Various tokens (L1 & L2) deployed on Oasys will be available for payment in your game.
  - Payment can also be made using tokens on networks other than Oasys, such as Ethereum(It is necessary to set the token used for payment).
